# Mobile-Price-Range-Prediction-App

Deployed on Heroku: https://mobile-price-range-prediction.herokuapp.com/

This project is about classifying the price range of a mobile phone, given some of its specifications like RAM, screen resolution, internal memory etc.  

The dataset that I used to train my model can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/iabhishekofficial/mobile-price-classification

The whole workflow of this project (apart from building and deploying the Flask app) is shown at Exploratory Data Analysis and Model Selection.ipynb
